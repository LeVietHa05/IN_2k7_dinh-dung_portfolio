      "Through the symbolic variant, wild orchids under extreme, contrast painting style, “The Orchid” provokes an irritable sense of women under social norm, a fervent rising up of feminism yet the alluring and sexyness of curves.",
      "During a visit to our city’s botanical garden, I stumbled upon a vibrant field of orchids, showcasing a variety of species—from moth and boat orchids to slipper orchids and even vanilla orchids. Each flower, with its distinctive form, exuded a unique beauty while collectively evoking a shared symbolism: femininity.",
      "This imagery sparked a thought - how often do young artists, including myself, grapple with representing women and gender distinctions without resorting to over-sexualized depictions? Why not use the orchid as a metaphorical illustration of femininity, embodying its elegant curves and delicate beauty? And thus, the concept was born.",

The rich contrast between the warm yellow hues and cool blues draws the viewer's attention, evoking a sense of calm and balance.

      `"Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier" is a renowned painting by French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne. Created around 1893–1894, this work is considered a masterpiece of still-life painting and showcases Cézanne's innovative approach to composition, form, and color, which significantly influenced modern art.`,
      `This masterpiece by Paul Cézanne has been a significant source of inspiration for me in mastering oil painting on canvas. In my view, "Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier" is far more than a depiction of an ordinary still-life table; it embodies the profound artistic vision of the artist. Cézanne's meticulous use of varied color tones to craft a dynamic background, his skillful rendering of the jars' luminous surfaces, and his nuanced portrayal of the irregular folds of the tablecloth all demonstrate his extraordinary attention to detail and innovative approach to composition.`,
